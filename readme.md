## Conclusions
This horizontal bar chart shows how often each answer option was correct. Option B was right most frequently, followed closely by C, A, and D —all within roughly the same range—while option E lags far behind. This sharp drop‐off for E suggests that very few questions offered a fifth choice. The relative parity among A–D indicates there isn’t a strong overall bias toward any single one of those four positions, but the near‐absence of E reveals an uneven distribution of answer slots in the quiz design.
